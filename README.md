### Description ###
Mathematica package dedicated to investigation of Nash equilibria existence in quantum extended games based on EWL scheme. 
The package offers various functions to support user to examine these extensions and other bimatrix games in more detail.

The package provides several functions to enable users to analyze these equilibria in greater detail. 
Specifically, one might explore the characteristics of two kinds of extensions, utilizing either one 
or two quantum strategies when applied to a classical game introduced by a user as a package input. 
In addition to quantum games properties, the package facilitates the analysis of both security strategies
and minimax pure strategies. The package offers the elimination of dominant strategies. These features can 
be used for classical games. Reporting to a pdf is available. 

### References ###
The package is based on the mathematical concept and formulas covered in [2404.06196](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06196) and [2405.07380](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.07380)

### Basic usage ###
Two Mathematica notebooks with examples of use are provided with the package:
 - Extensions.nb - introduction to creating the quantum extensions of classical games and testing their properties.
 - Solver.nb - introduction to package functions for studying properties of any bimatrix games.
