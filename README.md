### Description ###
Mathematica package dedicated to investigation of Nash equilibria existence in quantum extended games based on EWL scheme. 
The package offers various functions to support user to examine these extensions and other bimatrix games in more detail.

### References ###
The package is based on the mathematical concept and formulas covered in [2404.06196](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06196) and [2405.07380](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.07380)

### Basic usage ###
Two Mathematica notebooks with examples of use are provided with the package:
 - Extensions.nb - introduction to creating the quantum extensions of classical games and testing their properties.
 - Solver.nb - introduction to package functions for studying properties of any bimatrix games.
